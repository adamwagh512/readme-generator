## Description
This is a README file generator.It allows users to generate readme files based on the answers to a few simple questions. It was built to satisfy the requirments of challenge 9 from the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate everything we have learned through Unit 9. 

## Installation Instructions
To install the app you must first go to https://github.com/adamwagh512/readme-generator and download the files. Once you have the files, you can open them up in your VS Code integrated command terminal. Once in the code type 'npm -i' to download all needed files. 

## User Instructions 
Once the program is installed, go to the command line and type 'node index.js' to run the program. Answer all of the questions appropriately. Once all the questions have been answered, you will see a file named README1 appear in your file explorer on the left hand side of your screen. Open that file and enjoy!
